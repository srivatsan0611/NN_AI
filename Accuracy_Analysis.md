Preface:

    1) The Library Based Implementation has TWO hidden layers, The Whitebox has ONE.
    2) The Training Data's shape is (1022,10) -> (1022,)
            As a result, epochs and iterations = 1022 for equal analysis.
    3) The analysis is based on the results posted when ran as in the files attached.
    
Analysis: 

A result of the 2 hidden layers in the Library Implementation makes the computational complexity more than the Whitebox Implementation

Accuracy of the Library Implementation -> 89.95434045791626 % 
Accuracy of the WhiteBox Implementation -> 90.99978271179401 %

Reason: 

The reason for the whitebox implementation having accuracy greater than the library implementation is because, the dataset so chosen for the given problem
is sampled (easy to work with, in a way) and therefore, this particular whitebox approach is easy to deploy.

However, when these two algorithms are used to big data, the optimizations (time-space compensation) in the library makes it usable and doesn't change
the time complexity by that much, as when done in a whitebox approach.
